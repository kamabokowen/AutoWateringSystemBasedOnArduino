# Auto Watering System Based On Arduino
This is my graduation design for my bachelor's degree. 

It is an automatic flower watering system, the main control is based on Arduino Leonardo, using ESP8266 as a Wi-Fi module. 

It enables the user to monitor not only the humidity and temperature of the soil in nearly real time, but also the temperature and humidity of the environment. 
The program is based on Blinker cloud platform, also support Mijia Xiaoai, and Server-Chan WeChat push.

I'd like to give special thanks to DFrobot. although I couldn't use it in the end because of the compatibility problem of FireBeetle, they gave me a lot of inspiration and inspiration. people from Arduino Chinese community and official community also helped me to solve many problems.

## List of sensors used
* DHT11 Temperature and humidity sensor
* DS18B20 Waterproof Temperature Sensor
* Soil moisture sensor (analog signal)
